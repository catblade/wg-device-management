# An example of a node with two example.com SR-IOV NICs
#
# In this device, the behavior is:
# - Each card has two PFs
# - Each PF has 2 VFs
# - The devices that are published are PFs and VFs.
# - The `sriovType` attribute can be used to differentiate between PF and VF.
# - Each VF also has a PF attribute, to allow constraints and selection based on
#   the PF.
#
# This node (node-00) has two of these cards, each associated with a different
# CPU/NUMA/PCIe package, represented here by the "numa" attribute.
#
# Each card gets published as a DevicePool with shared resources for the VFs.
