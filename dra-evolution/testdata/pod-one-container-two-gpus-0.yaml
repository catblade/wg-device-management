# A Pod asking for a two Foozer GPUs and associating them with one container.
#
# Notes
#
# Since we want to allocate a pair of GPUs, this is more than we can do with a
# simple `resourceClaims` construct. Instead, we need to create a claim template that
# looks like what we want. Ideally, we would embed all of this directly in the
# PodSpec, but we cannot because PodSpec is already v1 and we cannot make major
# changes that we are not completely sure we will not have to rollback.
